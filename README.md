# Neural_Networks_5782
Course at Ariel University during the spring semester.
## Project 1
There are four parts to homework:
- Part A: Implement the Adaline learning algorithm and show how it generalizes to develop a decision that works on all the set. Only when x,y <= 100 does <x,y> have value 1.
- Part B: The Adaline learning algorithm from part A is used for the new formula. Only when 4 <= x^2 + y^2 <= 9 does <x,y> have value 1. The algorithm should fail.
- Part C: Instead of adaline, use back-propagation algorithm for the formule: 4 <= x^2 + y^2 <= 9
- Part D: The neurons from the next to last level of Part C are used as input and only an Adaline is output.
